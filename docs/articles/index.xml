Quaddressing relies on imprecision to aid human judgement instead of relying on highly specific measurements of varying units across different types of documents, thereby greatly increasing the ease and efficiency of both encoding and interpretation across all documents for both human actors and code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>my process for creating new Hugo sites</title><link>https://ajsmith.co/articles/hugo-github-pages-workflow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/articles/hugo-github-pages-workflow/</guid><description>My current documentation, in bash code, for creating a new Hugo site hosted on Github pages.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://ajsmith.co/articles/minimal-citation-standard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/articles/minimal-citation-standard/</guid><description>I have always been annoyed with existing citation standards that are arcane and arbitrary to the degree that you either need to check back against templates for each content type, or use some software tool that enforces its own structure on your citation to hide the complexity of the ultimate output.
Is it possible to come up with a citation formatting standard that optimally balances this matrix of competing goals:</description></item><item><title/><link>https://ajsmith.co/articles/page-numbers-as-content/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/articles/page-numbers-as-content/</guid><description>Page numbers are typically thought of as metadata, after all, they look like metadata, and they appear to describe the structure of the document. When reading a novel, for example, we don&amp;rsquo;t think of the page numbers as being part of the prose we paid to read.
But in recent work, I have had to rethink the role of page numbers as metadata in the following situations:
I am transcribing a hand-written journal that may have no page numbers.</description></item></channel></rss>
