A summary of a few of my more consequential endeavors of the past decade.

## Mitime

[thisismitime.com](http://thisismitime.com) 

Mitime (pronounced "my time") is a minimal metastructure mapped over standard time that counts down available time in a day to organize time more effectively. My original concept, design, coding and copy.

Responsive Hugo site hosted on Github pages with custom Hugo modules that use Javascript to dynamically manipulate SVG images.

Desktop home page (the theme switches to a dark background during certain times of the day):
